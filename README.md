# roadbuilder
Build road just like in a simcity game.

Features:
- Create/Delete roads of 3 curve types: straight/arc/bezeir
- configure your lanes with maximum freedom
- automatically create round and smooth intersections
- intelligent assisting tool (sticky mouse pointer, extension of current road, easy-to-do 90 degree intersection, show angle in degree, etc.)
- support elevated road and 3D objects on road side

Next step (winter break):
- fix sharp crossings for elevated road
- lane configuration for crossroads
- traffic simulation

Postponed:
- continuity of dashed objects (Minor feature but complicated algorithm; problem can be eased by increasing dash density)
- bridge support position management (Not a key feature)
- "exit"(lanes in different directions) in addition to "crossing"(roads in different directions) (quite complicated)
