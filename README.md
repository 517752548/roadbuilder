# roadbuilder
Build road just like in a simcity game.

## Building tools
- Create/delete roads of 3 curve types: straight line / arc / bezeir curve
- round and smooth intersections
- intelligent and easy drawing
- support elevated road and 3D objects on road side

### Unfinished but postponed:
- continuity of dashed objects (Minor feature by complicated algorithm; problem can be eased by increasing dash density)
- bridge support position management (Not a key feature)
- "exit"(lanes in different directions) in addition to "crossing"(roads in different directions) (quite complicated)

## Traffic Simulation(currently under development)
- lane configuration for crossroads (need new UI)
- navigation from source to sink
- longitudinal and lane-changing behavior

## 3D modeling of a real-world Overpass(Updated 11/23/18)
