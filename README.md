- configure your lanes with maximum freedom
- automatically create round and smooth intersections
- intelligent assisting tool (sticky mouse pointer, extension of current road, easy-to-do 90 degree intersection, show angle in degree, etc.)
- support elevated road and 3D objects on road side

Under development:
- fix sharp crossings for elevated road
- connectivity of dashed objects
- bridge support position management(manually)

Features to develop:
- traffic
- "exit"(lanes in different directions) in addition to "crossing"(roads in different directions)
